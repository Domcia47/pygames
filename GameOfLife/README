WELCOME TO THE GAME OF LIFE

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game where the evolution of the board depends on its initial state and a set of rules.

The rules of the game according to Conway:

- A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive in the next time step (is "born").
- A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors remains alive; with any other number of neighbors, it dies (from "loneliness" or "overcrowding").

VERSIONS:
Python 3.11.7
Pygame 2.2.0

USAGE:

In command line type: 


python GoL_start.py


You can run the program without any command line arguments - a main manu is opened then.

You can run with a text file as argument e.g.


python GoL_start.py pulsar.txt


The file will be read in and the program will start automatically in the Draw board mode.

IN MAIN MENU:

You can choose 2 modes:

1. Draw board:
In this mode you are drawing cells by clicking on the screen - if you click on a dead cell (black) it becomes a living cell (white) and if you click on a living cell it becomes a dead cell.

If you're ready - click ENTER.

Your board will be saved in cells.txt file.

2. Random board
In this mode the board is randomly generated and the game starts automatically.


THE GAME:

After choosing the board you can observe life of the cells. It will work by itself from now, but there's an additional functionality - you can still click on the board and change the state of each cell similarily to the draw mode.


HAVE FUN!
